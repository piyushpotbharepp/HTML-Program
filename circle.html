		<h2 style="color: white;">A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre;<br> equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant.</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius.</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number (Circle with {\displaystyle r=0}r=0 is a degenerate case).</h2>
