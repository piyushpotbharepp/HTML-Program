		<h2 style="color: white;">Rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles.</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">It can also be defined as: an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles<br> are equal (360°/4 = 90°); or a parallelogram containing a right angle.</h2>
		<h2 style="color: white;">A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a square. The term oblong is occasionally used to refer to a non-square rectangle.</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">The word rectangle comes from the Latin rectangulus, which is a combination of rectus (as an adjective, right, proper) and angulus (angle).</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">A crossed rectangle is a crossed (self-intersecting) quadrilateral which consists of two opposite sides of a rectangle along with the two diagonals (therefore only two sides are parallel).</h2>
