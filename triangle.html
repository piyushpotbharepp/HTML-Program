		<h2 style="color: white;">A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted {\displaystyle \triangle ABC}\triangle ABC. </h2>
		<h2 style="color: white;">In Euclidean geometry, any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a two-dimensional Euclidean space).</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">In other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane.</h2> 
		<h2 style="color: white;">If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true.</h2>
